**Last working item**:
-   Last item agent was working: The user reported a runtime error after the implementation of the Share Product feature. The agent was in the process of debugging this error.
-   Status: BLOCKED
-   Agent Testing Done: N
-   Which testing method agent to use? The next agent should manually test the fix in the browser. Since this is a browser security policy issue, automated testing agents may not be able to replicate or verify the fix correctly. The agent should check the browser console for errors.
-   User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   Issue 1: (P0) Clipboard API is blocked due to a permissions policy.

  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1:
     - **Description**: The Copy URL and Share on Instagram buttons on the product detail page are failing with the error:  This prevents users from copying the product URL.
     - **Attempted fixes**: None yet. The agent was about to start debugging when the session ended.
     - **Next debug checklist**:
       1.  **Investigate the Error**: The error  points to a  issue. The Clipboard API requires a secure context (HTTPS) and must be triggered by a direct user action. The preview environment might be imposing a strict policy.
       2.  **Examine Code**: Review the  component in .
       3.  **Find Fallback**: If the policy cannot be changed, the agent must implement a fallback. Instead of directly writing to the clipboard, show a toast message like URL copied! but also consider a more robust solution like displaying a modal with the URL in a text field for the user to copy manually. This provides a better UX than a silently failing button.
     - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: Fixing this will make the product sharing feature functional, improving user engagement and the potential for organic marketing.
