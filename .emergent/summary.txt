**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application foundation has been built.
-   **Frontend**: A React application with the requested Gen-Z aesthetic (black/white/red theme). It includes pages for Home, Products, Product Detail, Cart, Wishlist, Login, and Registration. An  is set up for managing user sessions. Several pages are partially connected to the backend APIs, but a significant portion of the logic, especially for cart, checkout, and admin functionalities, remains either as placeholder UI or is not yet implemented.
-   **Backend**: A robust FastAPI application with a complete set of REST API endpoints for all required features (products, categories, users, auth, orders, reviews, etc.). MongoDB models are defined for all collections. The authentication system is fully implemented, supporting both Google OAuth and Email/Password with JWTs, bcrypt hashing, rate limiting, and other security hardening. A seeding script () was created and run to populate the database with initial data.

**Last working item**:
-   Last item agent was working: The agent was starting the final 5% of the project, focusing on the critical checkout flow. The last concrete action was creating the initial placeholder files for the  and .

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Complete Frontend API Integration**
    -   Where to resume: Systematically go through all frontend components (, , , etc.) and replace any remaining mock data or  logic with API calls to the live backend. This includes cart management, which is currently a mix of local and incomplete backend logic.
    -   What will be achieved with this? The frontend will be fully dynamic and reflect the state of the database, making it a true full-stack application.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks**:

-   **Backend Architecture**: Built the entire FastAPI backend with all required models, API routes, and business logic for products, users, orders, etc.
-   **Authentication System**: Implemented a dual authentication system (Google OAuth + Email/Password) using JWTs, httpOnly cookies, and bcrypt hashing.
-   **Security Hardening**: Added rate limiting to login endpoints and implemented generic error messages to prevent account enumeration.
-   **Database Seeding**: Created and executed a  script to populate the MongoDB database with initial sample data.
-   **Partial Integration**: Connected the , , and  to the backend to fetch dynamic data. The auth flow is also connected.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   None. The previous runtime error  was identified and fixed.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**

**All files of reference**
-   : Needs full implementation for the payment flow.
-   : Directory containing placeholder admin panels that need to be built.
-   : Central service for all frontend-backend communication.
-   : Manages global user authentication state.
-   : Main FastAPI application file that ties all backend components together.
-   : Directory containing all API route logic, separated by domain.
-   : Defines all database schemas.
-   : Contains critical security functions for auth.
-   : Script to populate the database with initial data.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The admin pages in  are currently just placeholders and require a full implementation.
-   The cart logic needs to be centralized and rely entirely on the backend APIs, removing any residual  or mock data dependencies.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The user has provided a very detailed, multi-phase plan. Adhering to the priority list is crucial. The current priority is **completing the checkout flow**.
-   The project uses Emergent's built-in Google Auth and mocks Razorpay for now. The backend is structured to accept real Razorpay keys via environment variables when available.
-   An infrastructure issue was noted where the preview URL sometimes returned a 404, even though the application was running correctly on localhost. Do not spend time debugging the preview URL; focus on local development and verify changes there.
-   The decision to use React over Next.js was explicitly confirmed by the user.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **User**: Approves the auth system and directs the agent to add security hardening (rate limiting, etc.).
2.  **Agent**: Implements rate limiting and improved error messages on the backend.
3.  **User**: Instructs the agent to complete the final 5% of the project, prioritizing the Checkout Flow, then the My Orders page, and finally the Admin panels. Provides a detailed checklist for completion.
4.  **Agent**: Acknowledges and begins implementing the checkout flow by creating  and .

The user's last message is a clear directive to complete the remaining core e-commerce functionalities, with the checkout process being the absolute top priority.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken**: The external preview URL sometimes fails due to infrastructure issues.
-   **Mocked**: Razorpay payment integration is mocked. The system is ready for real keys.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **Google OAuth**: Implemented via Emergent's built-in authentication system.
-   **Razorpay**: Planned for payment processing. The backend structure is in place, but it's currently mocked. Requires User API Key for production.
-   **bcrypt**: Used for password hashing.
-   **Framer Motion**: Used for frontend animations.

**Testing status**
-   Testing agent used after significant changes: NO
-   Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
-   Test files created: []
-   Known regressions: None

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   A test user was registered via the API:
    -   **Email**: 
    -   **Password**: 

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent has not forgotten any tasks but is in the middle of a large, multi-step implementation plan provided by the user. The most significant outstanding items are the full implementation of:
1.  The Cart & Checkout Flow (currently just placeholder files).
2.  The My Orders page for customers.
3.  The entire Admin Dashboard UI and its connection to the backend.</analysis>
